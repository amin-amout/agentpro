  "ProjectOverview": {
    "Title": "LocalNetChat",
    "Description": "A lightweight desktop chat application that enables users on the same local network to exchange text messages, display user status, and share files. The application uses peer\u2011to\u2011peer communication over TCP/UDP and is designed for office, educational, or home environments where internet connectivity is limited or unavailable.",
    "Scope": "Desktop clients (Windows, macOS, Linux) with optional mobile preview. No external server; all data is transmitted directly between clients.",
    "Stakeholders": [
      {
        "role": "End User",
        "description": "Employees, students, or home users who need quick local communication."

        "description": "Builds and maintains the application."
      }
    ],
    "Assumptions": [
      "All clients are on the same subnet or can discover each other via multicast/broadcast.",
      "Users have permission to open required ports on local firewall.",
      "File sizes are limited to 100\u202fMB per transfer to keep bandwidth usage reasonable."
    ],
    "Constraints": [
      "No internet or cloud services.",
      "Cross\u2011platform compatibility with Java 17 (Swing) or Electron/Node.js.",
      "Security: encryption optional but recommended; no user authentication beyond local login."
